    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Parth Nanda" class="profile-photo">
    <p>
      I’m an undergraduate Physics student at St. Xavier’s College with a growing passion for Astrophysics, cosmology, and applied research. My internships at SAC-ISRO and in space technology and rocketry introduced me to satellite data analysis, remote sensing workflows, propulsion concepts, and orbital mechanics, and these areas continue to shape how I think about space systems. I enjoy working through complex problems, experimenting with new tools, and staying detail-oriented in projects that demand precision and curiosity. I’m motivated by learning through practice and exploring ideas that connect theory with real-world applications. Outside academics, I often turn to photography, especially landscapes and astrophotography, as a way to slow down and observe the world more closely.

    <h2>Research & Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TEC Prediction with GNSS–Aditya-L1 & LSTM; Space Applications Centre (ISRO): </strong>Developed an LSTM-based TEC forecasting model using GNSS VTEC and Aditya-L1 solar data, performing STEC to VTEC processing, filtering, feature engineering, and low-error predictions in a full Python workflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Extended Kalman Filter for GPS Positioning; Space Applications Centre (ISRO): </strong>Developed an EKF framework for GPS navigation across multiple dynamics, including state/measurement modelling, clock-error handling, noise covariances, and Newton/Gauss-Newton initialization.</li>
      <li><strong>Rocket Physics, Propulsion & GMAT Orbital Simulations; STAR: </strong>Worked with propulsion relations, ascent dynamics, mass–staging analysis, and orbital calculations, and ran GMAT simulations for circular and transfer orbits.</li>
      <li><strong>Study of the Doppler Effect; St. Xavier’s College: </strong>Simulated Doppler shifts with a rotating sound source, comparing measured and theoretical frequencies with <1% error, and presented the results.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Wavefunction Tunneling & Trapping; St. Xavier’s College: </strong>Simulated Gaussian wave packets in a 1D finite well using Crank–Nicolson TDSE, showing tunneling, reflection, and trapping, and analyzing bound-state occupations via eigenstate projections.</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Equivalent of Heat (J) Using Thermocouple-Arduino; St. Xavier’s College: </strong>Built an Arduino–thermocouple setup to measure temperature rise during electrical heating and compute J=E/Q, including signal conditioning, calibration, and full data-analysis workflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis of Resonance in a Series LCR Circuit; St. Xavier’s College: </strong>Measured current across varying AC frequencies to identify the resonance peak and confirm impedance minimization through experimental plots.</li>
    </ul>
